# Overview

This is a comprehensive SaaS legal practice management system built as a full-stack application. The system provides complete case management, financial control, client relationship management, and billing automation for law firms. It features a multi-tenant architecture with role-based access control supporting three account types: Simple (basic), Composite (intermediate), and Management (full access). The system integrates with external services like Stripe for payments, email automation for billing, and provides advanced features like automated invoice collection and legal publication monitoring.

**Recent Major Update (August 2025)**: Complete admin authentication system implementation with dual authentication flows for regular users and system administrators.

# Recent Changes

- **Database Schema Updates**: Added AdminUser and AdminRefreshToken models to Prisma schema
- **Frontend API Integration**: Updated login/registration pages to use real APIs instead of mock data
- **Registration Key System**: Converted user registration from manual fields to secure registration key system
- **Initialization Scripts**: Created `scripts/create-admin.cjs` and `scripts/create-test-registration-key.cjs` for system setup

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Routing**: React Router 6 in SPA mode for client-side navigation
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 3 with custom design system and shadcn/ui components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for robust form handling
- **State Management**: React Query for server state and local React state for UI
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling via TailwindCSS

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with multi-tenant schema isolation
- **ORM**: Prisma for database operations and migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT access tokens (15min) + rotating refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing, helmet for security headers, rate limiting
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with standardized error handling

## Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
- **Schema-based isolation**: Each tenant gets a dedicated PostgreSQL schema
- **Cross-tenant validation**: Middleware ensures data access is restricted to tenant scope
- **Account types**: Simple accounts have limited financial features, Composite/Management have full access
- **Dynamic schema creation**: New tenants automatically get isolated database schemas

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Dual Authentication System**: Separate authentication flows for regular users and system administrators
- **Admin Authentication**: Complete admin panel with `/api/admin/auth/*` endpoints for admin-specific operations
- **Registration keys**: Secure invitation system for new accounts using registration keys instead of open signup
- **Role-based permissions**: Different feature access based on account type (SIMPLES/COMPOSTA/GERENCIAL for users, superadmin for admins)
- **Token rotation**: Refresh tokens are rotated on each use for enhanced security
- **Session management**: Automatic token refresh with graceful fallback to login
- **AdminUser Model**: Separate database schema for administrator accounts with role-based access control

## Module Architecture
The system follows a modular design with specialized modules:
- **Dashboard**: Real-time metrics with account-type-specific data visibility
- **CRM**: Client management with sales pipeline and deal tracking
- **Projects**: Case management with progress tracking and file attachments
- **Tasks**: Assignment system with Kanban boards and deadline management
- **Billing**: Invoice and estimate generation with PDF export
- **Cash Flow**: Financial management restricted to Composite/Management accounts
- **Receivables**: Automated billing collection with external payment integration
- **Publications**: Legal publication monitoring with task assignment workflow

# External Dependencies
